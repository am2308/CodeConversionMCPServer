# Which Deployment Model Should You Choose?

## 🤔 Decision Flow

```
Are you planning to provide this as a service to other users?
│
├─ YES (SaaS Model)
│  │
│  ├─ ✅ You create ONE GitHub App
│  ├─ ✅ You deploy to cloud platform  
│  ├─ ✅ You configure credentials once
│  ├─ ✅ Users just register and use your service
│  └─ 📋 Follow: GITHUB_APP_SETUP.md (SaaS section)
│
└─ NO (Self-Hosted)
   │
   ├─ Do you want full control over the infrastructure?
   │  │
   │  ├─ YES → Self-Hosted Model
   │  │  │
   │  │  ├─ ⚠️  Each deployment needs its own GitHub App
   │  │  ├─ ⚠️  Each user needs technical setup
   │  │  ├─ ⚠️  More complex maintenance
   │  │  └─ 📋 Follow: GITHUB_APP_SETUP.md (Self-Hosted section)
   │  │
   │  └─ NO → Consider using someone else's SaaS service
```

## 🎯 Recommended Approach

### Choose SaaS if:
- You want to build a business around this tool
- You want to serve multiple organizations/users
- Users prefer simple, no-setup solutions
- You're comfortable handling user data responsibly

### Choose Self-Hosted if:
- Enterprise customers with strict data requirements
- Organizations want full infrastructure control
- Highly regulated industries (finance, healthcare, etc.)
- Need extensive customization

## 🚀 Current Status

**Your Setup**: You've created a GitHub App and have it installed. You're ready for **SaaS Model**.

**Next Steps for SaaS**:
1. Complete your GitHub App credential configuration
2. Deploy to a cloud platform (Railway recommended)
3. Share your service URL with users
4. Users register and install your app with one click

**Users Never Need To**:
- ❌ Create their own GitHub Apps
- ❌ Configure .env files  
- ❌ Deploy anything
- ❌ Handle credentials

They just register, install your app, and start converting code!
